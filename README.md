# Introduction
Hello! My name is Trenton Noel, a second-year honors chemistry major and Spanish minor at Howard University.
In this course, I hope to learn how to organize datasets and present data in a simple way.
Github is challenging to navigate now, but by the end of the semester, I'll be a pro!
